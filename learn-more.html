                On January 2nd, 2026, I pushed out a neutered and arguably really buggy version of the SCN site.

            <h2 class="section-title">What Went Wrong?</h2>
            <p>
                As the site currently stands, it is a little buggy, and placeholders were left in the site, for example, in our network hub overview section. It's stated that we have 25.4k members, 8.2k members online, and 50+ channels. If you've ever been in that server, you know that the member count alone is completely wrong.<br><br>
                But that's kind of what I get for not paying attention and not updating placeholders to be actual stats. Another error is some anchors, aka links, actually are broken, so if you hover over the join shimmering community hub button, not only does it actually not go anywhere, which is another problem in its own right, but also when you hover over the button, you cannot see the text anymore because it transitions into the same color as the button, making it impossible to read. Another mistake is there are emojis left in some of the lists; for example, in the network benefits list, I left emojis to be replaced with Font Awesome icons, but I apparently just never got around to it.<br><br>
                My original band-aid fix was just to delete them, but I literally forgot them in one spot, unfortunately, if you were wondering why I was using those emojis as placeholders it was to see how the Font Awesome icons would look. And the final thing is I left a bunch of links that currently go nowhere because, like I said, this version of the site was extremely neutered down so I could push it out as quickly as possible. And in traditional fashion, I kind of found out that that was a very stupid idea and kind of just made the site look kind of shit, awkward, and unfinished.

            <h2 class="section-title">So What's Gonna Happen Now?</h2>
            <p>
                Well, you can probably guess it's not here anymore. . . kinda.<br><br>
                If you can tell this is obviously still the same site, it's just that there's not as much here now. The pages that were originally live have been replaced with a splash page and this Learn More page that you're currently viewing, and no, I'm not giving up on this site. I'm just going to put some more time and polish into it before I push it out. I don't know when it will be.<br><br>
                I hope it's some time. At least. Until next month. So, all the design principles and all that should stay the same as this current version.<br><br>
                Just with much more polish. Which, lucky for you, you actually get a sneak peek at a new design of something we've done only on the fallback site until now, which is community notices. And if you're wondering, no, I will not stop doing community notices on the fallback site. They'll still be done there.<br><br>
                I'm just now moving them to the main site as well, so you don't have to go to two different websites to get some information. I'm really happy with how this page turned out, and I'm excited to move the previous community notices and showcase the new ones here as well, and I will be doing a 2026 transparency report. I'm just waiting for the site to become more polished because I now have a page dedicated to transparency reports on this new site since I took down the docs back in December. I might try to work on the transparency report section on the website so that you can actually get access to it while I'm working on everything else, so I might focus exclusively on trying to get the transparency report section on the site ready and available so that you can access it.<br><br>
                Though if I do get that part of the page ready, it will only be able to download the transparency reports, so you will not be able to read them on the site. But in the final version you will be able to not only download them, but you will also be able to read them directly on the site. But for the time being, I would recommend you to still check out the Fallback site if you want to know more about SCN, as it is much, much, much more complete.
